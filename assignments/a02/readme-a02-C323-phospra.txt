I typed the readme and evaluation for the Team submission. I, with the help of Christian,
did the storyboard and seques and different view controllers. We did the buttons and 
their functionalities. 
I set up all the files and got all the classes started. I set up the Model and stuff for 
the MVC design pattern. I started the core data implementation. I did the settings view
controller and all the sub view controllers for it including the body info, with all the
sub views for that like the weight and activity, and units and setting up that so you 
could change between oz and ml. 
Also the calculations for the recommended amount of water
you should drink. I made it so you can see it in either ml or oz.
I started implementing the rest of the core data, user notifications, and maybe with will
implement the UIPickerView so we can do that instead of buttons or text input for the
units or wight and body activity.

We plan on recording a video then turning it in
