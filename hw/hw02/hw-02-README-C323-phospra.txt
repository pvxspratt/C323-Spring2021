C323 - Homework 02
Phoebe Spratt - phospra

I have completed all of homework 02. I made sure the app does not crash when the number of
questions are more than the array size, I made it just show them again. I also made the
answer box be clear whenever there is a new question shown.
I added interesting questions. 
No questions at the moment.
