C323 - Homework 04
Phoebe Spratt - phospra

I have completed all parts for homework 04, except for making the format work for
more than the iPhone SE. I know how to go about it, I just didn't have the time to do
it. I plan to use Auto Layout Constraints though.

I made a button so you can see the other reminders without having to add a new one every
time. And I made the buttons sort of round.

No questions
