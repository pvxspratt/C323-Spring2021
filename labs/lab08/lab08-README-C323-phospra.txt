C323 - Lab 08
Phoebe Spratt - phospra

I have completed both tasks of lab 08. I made the command line game and you get 6 tries.
I made the app and it works. I changed some of the recommended functions, like the random
number for the app. I made it just a simple Int.random(0...30) or something like that 
because I was not able to figure out quickly how to deal with ignoring functions? No 
questions from me at the moment.
