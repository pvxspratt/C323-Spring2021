C323 - Lab 10
Phoebe Spratt - phospra

I have not completed all of Lab 10. I was in the middle of making the user input to be 
set to be checked if it is an Int or a String. I am still working on the implementation
of the app still to make it work specifically for this tabbed app. So there's still a
