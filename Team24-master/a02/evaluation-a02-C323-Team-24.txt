Design Team:
a. our design for A01 turned out to be a lot more than we had expected. We took away the 
	plant buddy (for now but most likely for all) and now it's just a regular keep track
	of how much water you need to drink and calculate that recommended amount based on 
	weight and activity level.
b. in a02, we have completed all the views, input/output, persistance, and started with Core Data.
	We still need to finish up the user Notifications and making the app look pretty
	
Evaluating Assignment 01 design documentation
a.	Our documentation was good and detailed and it implemented what we want to.
	1. Our A01 followed the MVC design and so does the a02.
	2. All required user interface elements were correctly incorporated
	3. We planned to uses substantial use of all the frameworks; core data, and  user 
		notifications
	
b.	A02 beta went well, but some of the stuff from a01 was a little too much for us to 
	get done completely, but for the most part we were able to follow it and implement what
	we wanted to. some still need to be fixed up so they do exactly what we want but they 
	are coming along.
	What we have:
		- all the view controllers and the segues for them
		- all the view controller files and the Model
		- functions for calculating recommended amount of water
		- almost all buttons are working
		- persistant data
		- good start of core data implementation
		- labels and they change when the data changes
	
	What we need to do:
		- finish core data
		- user notifications
		- maybe UIPickerView
		- making app look pretty
		
We followed all Swift language conventions and the requirements specifications for both
a01 and a02
