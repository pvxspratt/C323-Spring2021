Team/Student Contract statement

A. timeline
1. By assignment 02 we will have:
	user interface: input/output of units, weight, plant name, recommended amount of 
					water per day, amount of water drank/watered so far
					views/controllers for main view controller, setting/status/history 
					tab view, split view for settings(body info, units, sounds, reminder)
					table view controller for history(see amount of water you drank for
					past days)
	Persistent settings/preferences: the units, your body info, the plant, and cups will
									all be stored so it will not have to be set every
									time you open the app. It'll stay the same until you
									choose to change it.
	
	We'll be using core data and core graphics. We will also make use of SpriteKit and
		User Notifications.
	
For the Final we'll do the finishing touches. We will implement whatever we did not get
to for assignment 02, and make sure everything works.

2. At least the main functionality of calculating the recommended amount of water you should
drink, planting your buddy and naming it, and the watering/drinking method will be 
submitted by assignment 02
